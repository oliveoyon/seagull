                        </div>
                        <p>SRC is an online Research and Freelance Research Project Monitoring Platform for Researchers. Who want to get help about monitoring a research project, translation services, language services, and knowledge sharing services SRC links between them. For example, two SRC registered scholars, one of them from Asia and another one from Europe. You would be appreciated that Europe is better than Asia in Education and Economics due to the Science and Technology. So, we link between a person from Asia and a person from Europe in a platform for sharing knowledge about a specific subject or research project, we think there will happen a good impact for both of the persons and their countries as well.</p>
